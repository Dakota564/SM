The instantaneous frequency (IF) is a basic parameter which may be used to describe the nonstationarity in a process 
it is based on the analytic signal 

Another interpretation of the IF uses a time-frequency distribution (TFD) and defines
the IF as the weighted average of the frequencies existing in the signal at time t
