rier frequency is changed according to the pattern determined by the code sequence.
In the FFH technique, the hop frequency is equal to fH = 1/TH. In the case of non-coherent
detection, to ensure the required orthogonality between the tones of the FSK modulation signal, a
minimum distance between them being a mult

Since spectral properties are frequently better displayed on a logarithmic frequency scale, it is customary to use a = 2-u
