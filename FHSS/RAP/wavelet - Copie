The FH signals can be seen as multiple frequency-shift keying (MFSK) signals whose carrier frequency changes regularly because its carrier frequency controlled by the pseudo-noise (PN) code hops continuously and randomly

The time-frequency analysis based on the combination of time domain analysis and frequency domain analysis
is an efficient way to analyze the FH signal as it can get the time-frequency distribution to describe the joint time-frequency characteristics of the signal.


By definition, theWVD does present the advantage of depending only on the signal.
Its role is central in TF analysis and it possesses a number of theoretical properties
[12, 16] among which one can mention its ability to be PERFECTLY LOCALIZED in the case
of linear FM signals. These appealing features have, however, to be paid at some
price because, for example, a WVD cannot be positive everywhere, thus forbidding a
local density interpretation. Furthermore, in accordance with the elementary identity
(a+b)2 = a2 +b2 + 2ab, the fully quadratic nature of the WVD is known to create
spurious cross terms, characterized by oscillating contributions located midway in
between any two interacting components

There is a compromise between Localization and interference
