Dans les syst√®mes de communications
In communications systems, two important requirements of a wireless communications channel demand the use of a pulse shaping filter. 
These requirements are: 
- generating bandlimited channels
- reducing inter symbol interference (ISI) from multi-path signal reflections.



Nyquist bandwidth B=1/2T is the minimum bandwidth for zero ISI
