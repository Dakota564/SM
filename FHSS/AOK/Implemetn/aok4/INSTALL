              INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:    AOK4.C


To install aok4.c and its test and information files, de-tar the 
file aok4.tar.Z you downloaded using:

		   uncompress aok4.tar.Z
                   tar -xvf aok4.tar


This will create the directory aok4 containing the following files:

	INSTALL         aok4.GUIDE      chirp.sig
	README          aok4.c          papertest.sig


aok4.c is written in the C language, and should compile immediately 
on most platforms.  Compile using:

	           cc aok4.c -lm -O4 -o aok


This will create the executable file ``aok'' that you can install in
the usual place.
